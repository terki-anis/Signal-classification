# Signal-classification
This is my final project for my control engineering degree. it consists simulating a looper of a hot strip mill via simulink in order to creat signals close to the ones we got frome a real hot strip mill in "EL HAJAR" factory.
The goal of creating these signals is to enrich our dataset in order to be able to detect fault signals and diagnoss the reason of the problem.
Our work gave great results with an RMSE of 92%.
